**Location:** Services page and/or services section on homepage

**Remove:**
- All price points ($5K, $10K/month, $15K, etc.)
- Current service categories (Profitability Audit, Full Service Retainer, Creative Services)

**Replace with these four industry verticals:**

### Vertical 1: Real Estate Agents

**Headline:** Marketing That Wins Listings

**Copy:** You are competing against agents with bigger budgets and better brand recognition. We level the playing field. Lead generation that targets genuine sellers. Conversion systems that stop leads falling through the cracks. Creative that positions you as the obvious choice.

**Subtext:** For independent agents and boutique agencies who want more listings without wasting money on marketing that does not convert.

**CTA:** Book Your Discovery Call

---

### Vertical 2: Buyers Agents

**Headline:** Attract Qualified Buyers Ready to Act

**Copy:** Your clients are not browsing. They are ready to buy and they need someone who can find what the market cannot. We build campaigns that attract serious buyers with capital ready to deploy. No tyre-kickers. No dreamers. Just qualified leads who need your expertise.

**Subtext:** For buyers agents who want a consistent pipeline of high-intent clients.

**CTA:** Book Your Discovery Call

---

### Vertical 3: Property Investors

**Headline:** Connect With Investors Actively Looking

**Copy:** Property investors are researching online before they ever pick up the phone. We make sure they find you first. Targeted campaigns that reach investors at the right moment. Lead qualification that filters out the curious from the committed.

**Subtext:** For agencies and advisors who serve the investor market and want higher quality leads.

**CTA:** Book Your Discovery Call

---

### Vertical 4: Builders

**Headline:** Fill Your Pipeline With Build-Ready Clients

**Copy:** Every quote you write for someone who is not serious costs you time and money. We generate leads from people who have land, finance, and intent. Your sales team spends less time qualifying and more time closing.

**Subtext:** For builders and construction companies who want leads that convert to contracts.

**CTA:** Book Your Discovery Call

---

## TASK 10: Add Risk Reversal

**Location:** Below the main CTA in offer section

**Add this text:**

```
No pitch. No pressure. Just a straight conversation about whether we can help. If we cannot, we will tell you.
```

---

## TASK 11: Add "Who This Is Not For" Section

**Location:** Homepage, before the final CTA section

**Add this new section:**

```
WHO THIS IS NOT FOR

This is probably not for you if:

• You are happy with your current results
• You want cheap leads, not profitable ones
• You are looking for a set-and-forget solution
• You are not willing to look at the data honestly

Still here? Book your call.

[Book Your Discovery Call →]
```

---

## TASK 12: Add Specific Case Example

**Location:** Problem section on homepage, after "Here is what nobody talks about"

**Add this paragraph:**

```
Last month, we audited an agency spending $11,400 on marketing. They had 147 leads. 4 appraisals. 1 listing. That is $11,400 for one listing. We found three gaps in their follow-up process. Same spend. Now they are averaging 6 listings a month.
```

---

## TASK 13: Strengthen Founder Section

**Location:** "Why Us" / "Built By Someone Who Has Sat In Your Chair" section

**Add this paragraph after the existing founder copy:**

```
We have sat where you sit. We know the difference between a tyre-kicker and a genuine seller. We know what it costs to lose a listing to an agent with better marketing. That is why we only work with agencies who are serious about fixing the problem.
```

---

## TASK 14: Add Social Proof Line

**Location:** Header area or above testimonials section

**Add:**

```
Trusted by independent agencies across Australia
```

---

## TASK 15: Add Call Breakdown to Footer CTA

**Location:** Final CTA section, below the button

**Add:**

```
Here is what happens on the call:

1. We ask about your current marketing and results (10 mins)
2. We identify where the biggest leaks likely are (5 mins)  
3. We tell you honestly if we can help (5 mins)

No contracts. No commitments. No awkward sales pitch.
```

---

## TASK 16: Add Photo Placeholder

**Location:** "Built By Someone Who Has Sat In Your Chair" section

**Add:** Placeholder for Andy's headshot on left side of section, alongside the "11+ Years in Real Estate" badge

**Note:** Photo to be provided separately
