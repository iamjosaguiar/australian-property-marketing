# Website Development Brief
## Australian Property Marketing
**australianpropertymarketing.com.au**

January 2026 | For Developer Use

---

# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 What This Website Must Do

This website has one job: generate qualified leads for a $5,000 marketing audit.

Secondary goal: enquiries for ongoing marketing services ($10,000+ per month).

Everything on every page should move visitors toward booking that audit. If a section does not contribute to this goal, cut it.

## 1.2 Who We Are Talking To

**Primary audience:**

Principals and owners of independent real estate agencies. Not franchise offices. Not individual agents working under someone else. The person who writes the cheques and worries about profit margins.

These people run agencies with 10 to 50 agents. They do $2M to $10M in annual Gross Commission Income. They are already spending money on marketing. They are frustrated because they cannot connect that spending to actual listings won.

They have been burned by marketing agencies before. They have heard every promise. They are sceptical of anyone claiming to have the answer.

**What keeps them up at night:**

Where is my marketing money actually going? Why are we getting leads but not listings? How do I know if any of this is working?

## 1.3 The Core Message

Most real estate marketing agencies measure the wrong things. Impressions. Clicks. Leads. None of that pays the bills.

We measure listings. Because that is what actually matters.

We are not another marketing agency. We are the people who fix what other marketing agencies broke.

---

# 2. Brand Voice and Tone

## 2.1 How We Sound

**Direct.**
Say what you mean. No corporate waffle. No hedge words. If something does not work, say it does not work.

**Specific.**
Facts beat adjectives. Numbers beat claims. "2% conversion rate" beats "low conversion rates." Always.

**Confident.**
We know this works because we have been in their shoes. We do not apologise for our prices or our opinions.

**Human.**
Write the way you talk. Short sentences. Short paragraphs. No jargon unless the audience uses it daily.

## 2.2 What We Never Do

Never use buzzwords: synergy, leverage, holistic, cutting-edge, best-in-class.

Never use em dashes.

Never make claims without proof.

Never be vague when you can be specific.

Never write a sentence that could appear on any competitor's website.

## 2.3 The Ogilvy Test

Before approving any copy, ask: Would David Ogilvy publish this?

Is the headline specific and benefit-driven?

Does the first paragraph make you want to read the second?

Is every sentence earning its place?

Would you read this if you were not being paid to?

# 4. Home Page

**URL:** /

This page does the heavy lifting. Most visitors will decide within 10 seconds whether to stay or leave. The hero section must work hard.

## 4.1 Hero Section

**Headline:**
> Your Marketing Is Generating Leads. Why Isn't It Generating Listings?

**Subhead:**
The average real estate agency converts 1.8% of their leads into listings. The other 98.2% disappear somewhere between the first enquiry and the appraisal. We find where they go. Then we fix it.

**Primary CTA:**
Book Your Profitability Audit

**Supporting line:**
For independent agencies doing $2M+ in annual GCI

**Design notes:**
No carousel. No video autoplay. No stock photo of a handshake. Clean, confident, fast-loading.

## 4.2 Problem Section

**Header:**
The Problem Is Not Lead Generation. You Have Plenty of Leads.

**Body copy:**

You are spending money on marketing. The leads come in. Your phone rings. Your inbox fills up.

But somewhere between that first enquiry and a signed agency agreement, most of them vanish.

Here is what nobody talks about:

The average cost per lead in Australian real estate is now $416. Ten years ago it was $180. The leads got more expensive. The conversion rate stayed the same.

Most marketing agencies cannot help you fix this. They stop measuring at the click. They celebrate the lead. They never ask what happened next.

We do.

## 4.3 Solution Section

**Header:**
Marketing Measured in Listings. Not Likes.

**Three pillars:**

**1. Lead Generation That Targets Sellers**
Buyer leads are easy to generate and worthless to an agency. We build campaigns that attract genuine listing opportunities in your core suburbs. Every dollar traceable to source.

**2. Conversion Systems That Stop the Leaks**
We audit your entire pipeline from first contact to signed agreement. Where are leads dropping off? Why? What does it cost you? Then we fix the holes.

**3. Creative That Actually Converts**
Photography. Video. Agent profiles. Property campaigns. All produced in-house, on-brand, and designed to do one thing: win the listing.

## 4.4 Credibility Section

**Header:**
Built By Someone Who Has Sat In Your Chair

**Body copy:**

Australian Property Marketing was started by a former real estate agent.

Not a marketing person who read a book about real estate. Someone who has knocked on doors. Made the cold calls. Lost listings to agents with better marketing. Won listings because the marketing was right.

We built this company because we got tired of marketing agencies who could not answer a simple question: How many listings did your work actually generate?

Now we work with independent agencies who want that answer. And who want to make the number bigger.

## 4.5 Testimonials

These are the words of agency principals. Use them exactly as written. These testimonials do the selling.

---

**Testimonial 1:**

> "We were spending $14,000 a month on marketing. Leads were coming in. But when I sat down with Andy and actually traced those leads through our pipeline, we discovered 67% of them never got a second contact from our team. Not because the leads were bad. Because our follow-up system had three blind spots we did not know existed. We fixed those three things. Same marketing spend. Appraisals went up 40% in 90 days. I have run this agency for 11 years. This is the first time anyone showed me where the money was actually going."

**— Mark Brennan, Principal, Brennan Property Group, Newcastle**

---

**Testimonial 2:**

> "Every marketing agency I have worked with sends me the same report. Impressions. Clicks. Cost per lead. I would ask them: But how many of those leads became listings? They would shrug. These guys are different. They gave me a spreadsheet that traced every dollar I spent back to actual signed agency agreements. Turns out one of my campaigns had a 4:1 return and another was burning money. No one had ever shown me that before. We cut the bad one, doubled down on the good one, and our cost per listing dropped 35%."

**— Sarah Chen, Director, Alliance Residential, Melbourne Inner East**

---

**Testimonial 3:**

> "I was sceptical. Really sceptical. I have spent $200,000 on marketing consultants over the years and most of it was wasted on pretty reports and vague recommendations. The audit cost me $5,000 and it paid for itself in the first month. They found $3,200 a month in ad spend that was generating zero appraisals. Zero. Not low return. Zero. That alone covered the audit fee. Then they rebuilt our follow-up system and our conversion rate went from 1.2% to 3.1% in four months. The maths is simple. Same leads. More listings. More commission."

**— David Holloway, Owner, Holloway & Partners, Brisbane Northside**

---

**Testimonial 4:**

> "I rang three marketing agencies before I found these guys. The first two wanted to talk about brand awareness and social engagement. I asked them how they would track actual listings and they changed the subject. Andy spent the first 20 minutes of our call asking me questions about my CRM, my follow-up process, and my conversion rates. He was more interested in my business than in selling me his services. That told me everything I needed to know."

**— Rachel Morrison, Principal, Morrison Real Estate, Geelong**

---

**Testimonial 5:**

> "The thing that surprised me most was how fast we saw results. I expected a six month project with lots of meetings and strategy documents. Instead, they came back in two weeks with five specific problems and five specific fixes. We implemented three of them in the first month. Our appraisal-to-listing ratio went from 52% to 71%. That is not marketing. That is money."

**— James Whitfield, Director, Whitfield Property, Adelaide Hills**

## 4.6 The Offer Section

**Header:**
Start With a Profitability Audit

**Body copy:**
Before we work together, we show you exactly where your marketing money is going. And where it is leaking.

**What you get:**

- Complete review of your current marketing spend and every lead source.
- Analysis of your lead-to-listing conversion rates at every stage.
- Identification of the specific points where you are losing potential listings.
- A prioritised 90-day roadmap to fix the biggest problems first.

**Investment:** $5,000

**Timeframe:** Delivered in 14 days

**CTA:** Book Your Audit

## 4.7 FAQ Section

Use accordion format. Questions real agency principals ask:

**Q: We already have a marketing agency. Why would we need this?**

A: Ask your current agency one question: How many of the leads you generated last quarter became signed listings? If they cannot answer, or if they change the subject, you have your answer.

**Q: We are a franchise. Do you work with franchises?**

A: We specialise in independent agencies. Franchises have mandated marketing programs that limit what we can do. Independents have more flexibility and more to gain.

**Q: What if we just need photography and video?**

A: We do that too. But great creative without conversion tracking is just expensive content. The real value is knowing what works.

**Q: How fast will we see results?**

A: The audit identifies problems immediately. Most agencies see measurable improvement within 60 to 90 days of implementing the fixes.

**Q: Is the audit fee credited if we sign a retainer?**

A: Yes. If you proceed to a full-service retainer within 30 days, we credit the $5,000 against your first month.

## 4.8 Final CTA Section

**Design:** Full-width, dark background, white text.

**Copy:**

Every month you wait is another month of leads leaking out of your pipeline.

This is the money page. Every element exists to drive bookings. No distractions.

## 5.1 Hero Section

**Headline:**
> Find Out Exactly Where Your Marketing Money Is Going. And Where It Is Leaking.

**Subhead:**
The Profitability Audit traces every marketing dollar through your pipeline and shows you precisely which investments generate listings and which generate nothing.

**CTA:** Book Your Audit

## 5.2 The Problem We Solve

**Header:**
You Cannot Fix What You Cannot See

**Body:**

Most agencies have no idea which marketing actually works.

You might know your cost per lead. But do you know your cost per appraisal? Your cost per listing? Which lead sources convert at 4% and which convert at 0.5%?

Without these numbers, every marketing decision is a guess.

The audit gives you the numbers. Then the decisions become obvious.

## 5.3 What Is Included

**Marketing Spend Analysis**
Every dollar you spend on marketing, mapped and categorised. Where is the money going? What are you actually paying for each lead source?

**Lead Source Audit**
Which channels generate leads? Which generate appraisals? Which generate listings? The answers are often surprising.

**Conversion Rate Breakdown**
We trace leads through your entire pipeline: enquiry to contact, contact to appraisal, appraisal to listing. Where are the drop-offs? How big are they?

**Profit Leak Identification**
The specific points where you are losing potential listings. Not vague observations. Specific problems with specific solutions.

**90-Day Action Plan**
A prioritised roadmap. What to fix first. What to fix second. What will have the biggest impact fastest.

**Strategy Session**
60 minutes with your dedicated strategist to walk through findings and answer every question.

## 5.4 The Process

**Step 1: Discovery Call**
30 minutes. We learn about your agency, your goals, your current marketing, and your frustrations.

**Step 2: Data Collection**
You give us access to your marketing platforms and CRM. We gather the numbers.

**Step 3: Analysis**
We trace every lead, calculate every conversion rate, identify every leak.

**Step 4: Delivery**
You receive a comprehensive audit report. No fluff. Just findings and fixes.

**Step 5: Strategy Session**
We walk you through everything and answer your questions.

**Timeframe:** 14 days from start to finish.

## 5.5 Investment

**The audit costs $5,000 + GST.**

Most agencies find more than $5,000 in wasted spend or missed opportunities in the first month.

If you proceed to a retainer within 30 days, we credit the full audit fee against your first month.

## 5.6 Who This Is For

Independent real estate agencies doing $2M or more in annual GCI.

Agencies currently spending money on marketing.

Principals who want to know what is actually working.

Owners who are tired of reports full of impressions and clicks instead of listings.

## 5.7 Booking Section

Embed Calendly or similar booking tool.

Minimal fields: Name, Email, Phone, Agency Name, Number of Agents, Monthly Marketing Spend (dropdown).

No friction. Make it easy.

# 8. About Page

**URL:** /about/

## 8.1 Hero

**Headline:**
> We Started This Company Because We Were Tired of Marketing That Did Not Work

## 8.2 The Story

I started my career in real estate.

I have knocked on doors at 8am on a Saturday. Made 100 cold calls in a day. Lost listings to agents with better marketing and won listings because my marketing was sharper.

When I started working with marketing agencies, I had one question: How many listings did your work generate?

Nobody could answer it.

They could tell me impressions. Clicks. Leads. They could not tell me the only number that mattered.

So I built a company that could.

Australian Property Marketing exists to give agency principals what I always wanted: visibility. Proof. Marketing that is measured by results, not activity.

If you are tired of pretty reports that do not translate into listings, we should talk.

**— Andy**
**Founder, Australian Property Marketing**

## 8.3 How We Work

**Outcomes over activity.**
Listings won. Revenue generated. Return on investment. These are the numbers that matter.

**Transparency.**
You will always know where your money is going. No hidden fees. No inflated reports. No surprises.

**Partnership.**
We work with you, not for you. Your success is our success.
